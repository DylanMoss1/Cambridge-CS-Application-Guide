title: 'My Personal Statement'
---

**This personal statement is written for the old format (pre-2026).**

**This is not a "model PS", but simply my personal statement, which successfully gained me admission to computer science at Cambridge University (2020 entry).**

**It does not use many of the techniques mentioned in my advice guide -- if I were to rewrite it now I would change many things. However, I have left it in its original form so people can see what a successful PS might look like.**

**Please do not copy anything from this PS (either consciously or subconsciously) or you might be pulled up for plagiarism.**

One day, my teacher was complaining to us in class about having to manually enter comments on students into his spreadsheet - tempted by the problem, I spent the rest of the day learning how to implement JavaScript programs into spreadsheets. By the afternoon, I had come back to the teacher with a working solution to automatically insert comments based on the student's previous marks. That is why I am fascinated by Computer Science; my love of analysing and solving problems has motivated me to take on new challenges and further explore the innovative world of computing. 

I find the concept of artificial intelligence intriguing and seeing how this technology is impacting our lives has sparked my passion to research machine learning. Wanting to better understand what is meant by an "artificial intelligence", I read the book Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark which opened my eyes to the ethical challenges we may face in the future when creating AI. My curiosity led me to learn how neural networks work and it was inspiring to discover that I could apply my maths knowledge to understand the fundamentals of machine learning. Using Tensorflow and joining data science competitions in Kaggle then allowed me to apply what I had learnt to create my own convolutional networks such as digit recognition and animal identifier programs.  

Seeking out new opportunities to develop my mathematical and lateral thinking skills, I have participated in many competitions; achieving Gold in multiple UKMT competitions and getting a distinction in the UK Bebras challenge. I found these competitions hugely stimulating and my desire to push myself further drove me to lead a team in a hackathon competition which developed my leadership and communication skills. To explore my interests in more depth, I attended masterclasses at Cambridge University, Imperial College London and at the Royal Institute of Mathematics. These thought-provoking lectures have made me realise the potential that technology has to revolutionise our future - introducing to me concepts such as blockchain and big data.  

The thrill that I get when solving maths and logic problems encouraged me to create my own programs in Python, such as Battleships, platformer games and a web scraping algorithm to track the prices for a new phone that I wanted to buy on Amazon. I have also greatly enjoyed completing the difficult but rewarding problems on project Euler which have forced me to think about computational efficiency in a new way.  

Setting up the school PTA website on Google Sites gave me a taste of a real-life project, turning requirements into a workable solution. I have also found that sharing my knowledge is as rewarding as learning, which is why I put myself forward as a Computer Science prefect and became the leader of my school's code club, to inspire the next generation into Computing the same way that I was.  

Beyond academia, I have been a committed member of the Scout organisation for over 12 years and achieved the Bronze and Silver DofE award with them. In order to support my community, I volunteered as a Young Leader at a local Scout group for 5 years and have completed the Scoutâ€™s Young Leader training course as part of this. Learning how to canoe and playing competitively in both Judo and cricket has helped enhance my self-discipline which I hope will hold me in good stead for this course.  

Being a motivated, passionate and enthusiastic learner, I have taken many opportunities to extend my knowledge in Computer Science by getting involved in both personal and real-world projects. I can see myself thriving in an environment where I am able to study fundamental concepts of Computer Science and can learn how to make positive contributions towards the innovations and discoveries that lie in the future.
