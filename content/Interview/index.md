title: 'Interview Advice'
---

This page is aimed at applicants preparing for computer science interviews at Cambridge, Oxford, and Imperial. Below are two full mock interviews that I have created, with accompanying hint and answer sheets. The advice in this page is relevant for most STEM subjects, however the interview questions are specifically targeted towards computer science applicants. 

The first section 

## Interview Questions 

**Before looking at these interviews, please read the rest of this page to ensure you can make the most of the questions provided.**

This section includes two mock interviews I created, each with accompanying question sheets, hint sheets, and answer sheets. While the questions are not taken from actual interviews, they closely resemble the types of questions that are likely to appear.


These interviews are intentionally challenging, and you're not expected to complete all the questions within the allotted time. The focus is less on how many questions you answer and more on how you approach and respond to unfamiliar problems.

### Interview 1
    
[Questions](interview-1-questions.pdf), [Hints](interview-1-hints.pdf), [Answers](interview-1-answers.pdf)

- Contains 1 computer science question (split up into 4 parts). 
- Can be treated as a pre-reading interview (the first 2 pages are pre-reading). 
- Expected to take around 45 mins. 

### Interview 2

Coming soon. 

# How to Use these Questions 

It is up to you to decide how you use these questions, but I highly recommend you **think carefully about how to make best use of them**. For example, you will get a lot more out of doing a mock interview with these questions, rather than just working through them by yourself in silence. 

Here are my recommendations for how to use these questions effectively: 
- Try to find someone willing to interview you, e.g.
    - Compsci friend / family (graduated from university)
    - Compsci school friends
    - Fellow compsci university applicants (such as on the Cam CS Admissions Discord server) 
    - STEM friends / family (graduated from university)
    - Compsci / STEM school teachers 
- Ask them to read through the questions, hints, and answers in advance so they understand the basics of the question (this is easier for anyone with previous computer science and/or maths knowledge).
- Put yourself under interview conditions (put up a clock timer, sit in a room alone with just you and the interviewer / conduct an online interview, give yourself scrap paper / a drawing tablet to work out your ideas on, clear out any other distractions). 
- If the interviewer is less experienced with computer science, they should let you work through the problem, and only jump in with hints if you are stuck for longer than 1 or 2 minutes without making any progress. 
- If the interviewer is more experienced with compsci, they should try and walk through the problem with you, responding to the ideas you pose to keep you pointed in the right direction. They should never tell you the answer, but they can steadily drop more and more hints if you are stuck. See these mock interviews [here] and [here] for an example of what this looks like. 
- Remember to keep going even if you are stuck, don’t be tempted to break the illusion of the interview even if you are being interviewed by a friend. A large part of the interview is seeing how you react when you are stuck on a problem. 
- You are not expected to finish all parts of all interviews in the time: most successful candidates do not! If you are on a question for a disproportionate amount of time, the interviewer should move on and then come back to the question at the end if you have time. It is better to attempt all parts of the interview, than to complete only half the interview and not look at the remaining question(s).  
- If you have permission from the interviewer, record the interview and watch it back later. This helps you understand what you look like from the interviewer’s perspective. 
- If you cannot find someone to interview you, then record yourself solving the problem and speaking your thoughts out loud.
