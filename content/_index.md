# Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Dylan, and I have recently graduated from my undergraduate and masters studying computer science at Queens’ College, Cambridge.

Over the past few years, I’ve answered many questions from Cambridge computer science applicants across various forums and servers. However, I often found myself repeating answers to the same questions -- ones that don't seem to be properly addressed by existing online resources. I found that most guides provide advice that is too generic and high-level to be useful.

**This guide aims to offer practical, actionable advice for future applicants.** 

While this guide is primarily designed to support Cambridge computer science applicants, many sections might also be helpful for those applying to other subjects and universities. 

I strongly believe that everyone should be given a fair and equal chance when applying to top universities, regardless of their background or school environment. If you found this guide useful, please share it with others who might also benefit from it!

## Disclosure

I do not represent and am not endorsed by Cambridge University in any way. The advice given in this guide is purely my own, derived from my own personal experience. I cannot guarantee this information is correct, and that it has not changed since my application. However, I have spoken extensively with interviewers, director of studies, current students, and university applicants to make this advice as useful as I can.
