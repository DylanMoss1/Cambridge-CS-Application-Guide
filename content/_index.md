# Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Dylan, and I have recently graduated from my undergraduate and masters studying computer science at Queens’ College, Cambridge.

Over the past few years, I’ve answered many questions from Cambridge computer science applicants across various forums and servers. However, I found myself repeating answers to the same questions -- ones that do not seemed to adequately addressed by existing online resources. Most available guides provide advice that is too generic and high-level to be useful.

In this guide I aim to provide tangible, actionable advice to future applicants. I want to provide helpful resources for anyone interested in applying to Cambridge computer science (or STEM subjects at any university), regardless of their background or school environment.

**This guide is aimed at Cambridge computer science applications. However, this advice may also be useful for those applying to Oxford, Imperial, and other STEM subjects.**

# Disclosure

I do not represent and am not endorsed by Cambridge University in any way. The advice given in this guide is purely my own, derived from my own personal experience. I cannot guarantee this information is correct, and that it has not changed since my application. However, I have spoken extensively with interviewers, director of studies, current students, and university applicants to make this advice as useful as I can.
