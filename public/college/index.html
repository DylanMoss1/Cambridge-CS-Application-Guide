<title>How to Choose a College | Unofficial Cambridge CS Application Guide</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="This section is aimed at choosing a Cambridge college for computer science (but much of this advice extends to Oxford and other courses).
The biggest lie told to applicants is that your college does not affect your university experience, teaching experience, or chances of getting in. This is not true.

Colleges can be quite different to each other, and there are many factors which may have an impact on your university experience.
Colleges are also in charge of organising your supervisions (small teaching groups for each subject), which are a large part of your learning experience at Cambridge.
Some colleges can be more competitive to get into than others.

So, given that colleges can have a large impact on your life at university, which should you choose? Unfortunately this is a very difficult question as different people have very different requirements and preferences.">

      How to Choose a College
    </h1>
    <div class="post-meta">

</div>
  </header> 
  <div class="post-content"><p>This section is aimed at choosing a Cambridge college for computer science (but much of this advice extends to Oxford and other courses).</p>
<p>The biggest lie told to applicants is that your college does not affect your university experience, teaching experience, or chances of getting in. <strong>This is not true.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colleges can be quite different to each other, and there are many factors which may have an impact on your university experience.</li>
<li>Colleges are also in charge of organising your supervisions (small teaching groups for each subject), which are a large part of your learning experience at Cambridge.</li>
<li>Some colleges can be more competitive to get into than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, given that colleges can have a large impact on your life at university, which should you choose? Unfortunately this is a very difficult question as different people have very different requirements and preferences.</p>
<p>The best thing I can do is give you a list of factors to consider when making your decision. Some of these factors may matter to you and some may not, but they might help you think about things you hadn&rsquo;t considered before.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that you will most likely enjoy your Cambridge experience no matter which college you apply to. Choosing a college just helps you better tailor your experience to what you are looking for. Most people love their colleges, and would not swap to another given the chance!</p>
<h1 id="factors-to-consider">Factors to Consider<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#factors-to-consider">#</a></h1>
<p>The following is a list of university experience factors to consider when choosing a college (in no particular order). The importance of each factor is purely subjective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How far / close are you to the city centre?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Colleges closer to the city centre are closer to the action, but may feel more surrounded / busy.</li>
<li>Colleges further from the city centre may feel bigger and more open, but can be further to travel to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How far / close are you to the lecture theatre:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In compsci first year, roughly half of the lectures are held in the New Museums Site, with the rest being held in the CL.</li>
<li>In all other years, most of your lectures are held in the Computer Lab.</li>
<li>If you live close to the city centre, it is only a 10-15 minute cycle to the CL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How far / close are you to the shops:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Look on Google maps to see where the nearest shops are (most central colleges shop at the Sainsburies on Sidney Street).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How touristy is your college?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some popular colleges (e.g. King’s, Trinity, St Johns) can get a bit busy during Easter / summer.</li>
<li>Some people mind tourists walking through their college, whereas others don’t.</li>
<li>How cheap is your college?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is the accommodation / food cheap?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does the college make you spend a minimum amount of money in the buttery per term (to keep the prices subsidised)?</li>
<li>Do you have to pay for extras such as laundry / gym?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How rich is your college?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does your college offer bursaries (such as academic bursaries, sports bursaries, travel bursaries, etc.).</li>
<li>Many colleges offer financial resources to help you (especially if you are financially struggling).</li>
<li>Make sure to check out both the <a href="https://www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-bursary">university bursary scheme</a> and your college’s bursary scheme (often found on your college’s website).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is the food good?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Is there a good cafeteria (aka buttery)?</li>
<li>Is there also an on-site cafe?</li>
<li>Is there a good selection of vegetarian / vegan / halal / etc. food?</li>
<li>Are formals good? (aka fancy dinners you may go to ~1–3 times a term).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How many people take your course?</strong>
<ul>
<li>These <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics">statistics</a> show how many people historically take each course at each college.</li>
<li>Some people prefer colleges with less course-mates, however, most people prefer colleges with more course-mates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The college architecture / environment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some people prefer older colleges with impressive architecture (e.g. King’s, St John’s, Trinity).</li>
<li>Other people prefer more green colleges (e.g. with garden areas, such as Fitzwilliam and Clare).</li>
<li>Some colleges contain cool landmarks (such as King’s College Chapel, Queens’ mathematical bridge, etc.)</li>
<li>For some people this won’t make a difference, it is up to you to decide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>College accommodation</strong>
<ul>
<li>College age
<ul>
<li>Older colleges tend to have bigger rooms but older infrastructure (it will likely be colder and things break more often).</li>
<li>Newer colleges typically have slightly smaller rooms but have newer infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rooms
<ul>
<li>Some colleges offer room plans / photos / videos online.</li>
<li>These can give you an indication of what rooms are like (but it is best to try and visit some on a college open day).</li>
<li>Do rooms contain good facilities (e.g. ensuite / shared bathrooms, how often are the bathrooms and kitchens cleaned, is there ethernet and is it fast, are the mattresses comfy or hard, what are the room views like)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gyps (Kitchens)
<ul>
<li>Are the gyps well equipped (note that most colleges do not provide ovens in gyps on the main site). Are there toasters, freezers, kettles, functional hobs, etc.</li>
<li>How many people share a gyp?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Main / Off-site
<ul>
<li>Most colleges do not offer all three years on the main site.</li>
<li>Colleges usually own off-site accommodation (typically with its own community, common rooms, etc.).</li>
<li>Some people prefer off-site accommodations due to their more modern rooms and tight-knit community. However, you may have to travel back to the college for events, buttery, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>
<ul>
<li>Formals
<ul>
<li>How regularly are formals held (typically between 1–7 a week, but you will usually only attend ~1–3 times a term).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other events such as: bops, garden parties, and may balls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sports</strong>
<ul>
<li>What sports facilities are available (e.g. badminton courts, squash courts, rowing teams, etc.).</li>
<li>Does your college have active societies for your favourite sports?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Facilities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Is there a nice (cheap) college bar?</li>
<li>What is the JCR (junior common room) like? This is a socialisation area for undergraduates, which may have a Wii / games console, board games, computers / monitors, bean bags, work areas.</li>
<li>Does the bar / JCR contain pool tables / table tennis tables / darts / etc. (and are they free)?</li>
<li>What is the library like? Does it have a nice atmosphere, how late/early is it open, can you walk in and get a space at any time or do you need to book in advance?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pastoral Support</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any special pastoral needs? Does the college have any specific resources to help students (most colleges have a pastoral officer)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-things-that-i-do-not-think-are-worth-worrying-about-are">Some things that I do not think are worth worrying about are:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#some-things-that-i-do-not-think-are-worth-worrying-about-are">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How posh are people at the college</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most people at most colleges are very down-to-earth. You are almost guaranteed to find people you get on with at any college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Academic performance (such as the Tompkins Table)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nobody at Cambridge cares much about each college’s academic performance.</li>
<li>Details about supervision quality, college academic support, etc. are much better indicators of how academically successful you will be at each college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>College horror stories</strong>
<ul>
<li>I’ve seen some “horror stories” circulating the internet for different colleges. Most are many years out of date, no longer relevant, or lack the relevant context.</li>
<li>I would try to avoid being influenced by these stories too much, as they are a bad indicator for what college life is really like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DoS (Director of Studies) Specialities</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can pick a college because the DoS (Director of Studies) specialises in an area you are interested in. However, this usually will not make a big difference to your academic experience (you are not likely to get many chances to discuss this interest with them).</li>
<li>Do not pick a college hoping that having similar interests to the DoS will help you during your interview &ndash; it will not!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supervisions">Supervisions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#supervisions">#</a></h3>
<p>Colleges (or more specifically, DoSes at colleges) organise your supervisions: small 2/3 person teaching groups for each subject. It is hard to determine how good supervisions are at different colleges are, as it can vary massively by supervisor. Most supervisors at most colleges are good, so this isn’t something to worry too much about about. But if you want to find out more details, it would be best to try to contact someone from that college directly (such as via LinkedIn).</p>
<p>Many colleges form small cliques which share supervisors, so don’t worry about small colleges having worse supervisors.</p>
<h3 id="admission-statistics">Admission Statistics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#admission-statistics">#</a></h3>
<p>You may have seen the previous years <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics">application statistics</a>, and being a typical computer science student you might immediately wonder if you can use these figures to your advantage.</p>
<p>My advice is to consider that many other applicants are doing the exact same thing! If you find a college with high admission rates, don’t assume that this trend will continue as everyone else might find it and apply to it.</p>
<p>There can still be a lot of benefit in seeing which colleges tend to have higher admission rates, but just be aware that this can vary a lot year-on-year and is largely affected by the “pooling” system (explained later on this page).</p>
<p>Although something to be aware of, Trinity tends to be the most competitive college to get into. Unless you have competed internationally for mathematics or computer science, you will likely struggle getting in. But if you are at this level, it would be a great opportunity to collaborate with like-minded peers.</p>
<h3 id="dudebase">Dudebase<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dudebase">#</a></h3>
<p>There is also a collection of colleges known as “Dudebase”: colleges with Dr John Fawcett as their DoS (director of studies). Dudebases colleges form a cluster which commonly share supervisions and run events such as student presentations.</p>
<p>Many Dudebase supervisions are taken by Dr John Fawcett. He is known as a very good supervisor, but there is always a small risk of not getting on with your supervisor (which can be a problem if your supervisor is your DoS – who is the person you would normally talk to about these problems).</p>
<p>About 8 colleges fall into this group, so it is worth checking the DoS of the college you are applying to, to see if this would apply to you.</p>
<h1 id="narrowing-down-your-choices">Narrowing Down Your Choices<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#narrowing-down-your-choices">#</a></h1>
<p>Ok so you have a set of factors to think about… what now?</p>
<p>I generally recommend narrowing your choices of colleges down to ~3/4, and then visiting these colleges on a Cambridge open day. Don’t underestimate how much of an influencing factor a college’s &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; is when you visit it in person. This is as good of a reason to choose a college as any!</p>
<p>If I were to choose my college from scratch, I would use the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/colleges-and-departments/college-a-z">31 colleges</a></li>
<li>Remove colleges you are not eligible for
<ul>
<li>Mature colleges for students aged 21 or over: Hughes Hall, St Edmunds, Wolfson</li>
<li>Female-only colleges: Newnham and Murray Edwards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick 2&ndash;4 of the most important factors from the list above and eliminate colleges that do not meet these criteria (more objective criteria like “location” work better here)</li>
<li>Write out your preferences for all of the remaining factors, and try to use these to narrow down your choices further to just 3/4 colleges</li>
<li>Visit these colleges on open day, and ask questions for anything you couldn’t find online</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to email the college if you have any other questions (such as: what is their pastoral support like, what bursaries do they have available, etc.)</li>
<li>If you are still stuck, try to reach out to students currently studying at those colleges (such as by LinkedIn). Most people would be more than willing to share their experience!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-practical-example">A Practical Example:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-practical-example">#</a></h3>
<p>Imagine you are a male under the age of 21 &ndash; so remove Hughes Hall, St Edmunds, Wolfson, Newnham, and Murray Edwards from the list of 31 colleges.</p>
<p>Then pick out 2&ndash;4 important factors. Say you have a preference for central colleges to be closer to the action, you also want a college which takes a lot of computer scientists each year (≥6), and you want a college with grand architecture as you think it would be a very cool place to live.</p>
<p>Using Cambridge’s <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics">statistics website</a>, you can find how many computer scientists attend each college each year.</p>
<p><img alt="image" loading="lazy" src="/../images/application_statistics.png#center"></p>
<p>In 2024 we can see that the colleges which took ≥6 people are: Churchill, Downing, Fitzwilliam, Gonville and Cauis, Homerton, Jesus, King’s, Lucy Cavendish, Queens’, Robinson, Johns, and Trinity.</p>
<p>Then I would look for central colleges using the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/colleges-and-departments/college-a-z">Cambridge Map</a>, which narrows down the list to: Downing, Gonville and Caius, Jesus, King’s, Queens’, Robison, Johns, and Trinity.</p>
<p>Out of these colleges, the I would consider the ones with grand architecture to be: King’s, Johns, and Trinity.</p>
<p>I would then try to visit these on an open day, and pick the college which meets the rest of my criteria the best. For example, if I enjoy badminton and King’s has an active badminton team then this might sway my decision.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you don’t get a chance to go to an open day &ndash; I chose my college (Queens’) without ever visiting it before! But if you do get a chance to visit the college in-person, then I would highly recommend it.</p>
<h3 id="open-day-planning">Open Day Planning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#open-day-planning">#</a></h3>
<p>You can find the next Cambridge open days on their <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/events/cambridge-open-days">website</a> &ndash; make sure to book your place! There are many talks that take place on these days, try to find the talks that are most relevant to you and incorporate them into your visit.</p>
<p>I highly recommend planning out your route in advance. It can take a while to walk between colleges and departments which are far away, so try to visit nearby colleges at the same time.</p>
<h1 id="open-applications">Open Applications<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#open-applications">#</a></h1>
<p>Open applications mean that you don’t pick any specific college to apply to, you are instead allocated to a college at semi-random. The college you are assigned to is generally one with less applicants compared to available places, in order to spread out the applications.</p>
<p>On one hand, this can increase your chances at getting in as you are typically assigned to less-competitive colleges. However, in practice this does not work out to be the case; the pooling system means that colleges have the freedom to take applicants that did not get into other colleges. It is not uncommon for colleges to take no applicants that applied to them (either directly or through open applications), but instead take all their applicants from the pool!</p>
<p>In general, while open applications may slightly improve your chances of admission, I would still recommend applying directly to a college that appeals to you. Since you’ll be spending three years at university, it&rsquo;s worth choosing a college that suits you well, as this can significantly affect your overall university experience.</p>
<h1 id="pooling">Pooling<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pooling">#</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/files/publications/guide_to_the_winter_pool_for_applicants.pdf">pooling</a> system is how Cambridge tries to make your chances of admission equal, no matter which college you apply to.</p>
<p>If you invited to interview, then you are always interviewed by the college you applied to (except if you make an open application). After your interview, colleges decide whether they would like to give you offer by considering all of the information in your application. If college X has 5 slots available, they would give offers to their 5 top applicants. However, if they think that the top 7 applicants were all worthy of receiving offers, they would put the 6th and 7th applicant in the &ldquo;Winter pool&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Another college Y may interview their set of candidates and only find 2 people they want to give offers to, but they have 4 spaces available. They would then look in the pool, and could take the two applicants to college X out of the pool and give them offers. So these applicants would have applied to college X, but instead are fished out of the pool and are given offers by college Y.</p>
<p>This is very common: oversubscribed colleges put many applicants into the pool, and undersubscribed colleges take many applicants out of the pool. This is why there is limited benefit in applying to undersubscribed colleges &ndash; it is not uncommon for these colleges to take most (if not all) of their applicants out of the pool!</p>
<p>It is quite likely for people applying to Dudebase colleges to be pooled into other Dudebase colleges, if there is no remaining space in the college you originally applied to. For example, Churchill is often oversubscribed, so many applicants tend to get pooled to other Dudebase colleges such as Homerton.</p>
<p>This process is known as the &ldquo;Winter pool&rdquo;, and it is <em>by far</em> the most common way to be pooled. There also exists a Summer pool, where applicants fail to meet their grade requirements and are therefore not accepted into the college. In this case, you are put into the Summer pool, where you can be picked out by other colleges looking for more people.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r68vXDcPepiu_7Ac1PQ2V-FmVyXol7Da_yPfOdm3RW0/edit?tab=t.0">document</a> was created as a collaboration between Cambridge computer science students. It contains information about people’s experience studying computer science at different colleges, as well as: interview vibes, supervision quality, and community.</p>
